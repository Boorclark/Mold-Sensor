## Purpose
*You'll complete this section as part of Milestone 1.*

In no more than one paragraph, describe the problem your product will solve, and how.

## Initial Design Plan
*You'll complete this section as part of Milestone 1, and update regularly.*

### Hardware Design
- List the hardware components you'll be using, and how they interact. 
  
This is an appropriate place for a diagram. An EXCELLENT resource 
for creating diagrams is the [Fritzing website](http://fritzing.org/home/ "Fritzing website")

**Sample image (to be removed)**:

![A sample image to show how to add one to a repo](images/example.png "A sample image. This is the text that appears.")

**NOTE**: Your initial design plan may not fully reflect your final product,
as projects evolve over time.

### Software Design
- List all of the classes and functions you'll be creating.
  - Your program must follow good coding standards. 
  Primarily, I mean your code should include meaningful functions 
  and appropriate variables, and be formatted and commented well. 
  - This is Python (not C), so *classes are expected* to be well-designed and used throughout.
  - Sloppy code with no structure will be penalized. 

This is an excellent place for a CRC card or two.

### Data Design
- Describe your data that will be saved on your device. In particular:
  - Describe the data itself (e.g., temperature), 
  - The frequency of the data saves (e.g., constant, minute, hour), 
  - The resolution of the data (e.g., calibrated, relative change)

A sample (i.e., table) of the data would likely make this section clearest.

## Files
*Data Folder: empty for now, but this directory will contain the files that contain the data*
*Images Folder: contains an example image*
*License: contains the licensing and copyright rules and regulations*
*README.md: contains detailed information on the project, and the milestone regulations *
*example-README.md: this file has the instructions on how the actual README.md should be formatted*
### Project Files
*List every file in your repository, and briefly summarize each file's purpose in a sentence.*

### Data Files
*Also list your data files here, which will be due during Milestone 2.*

## Instructions
*Explain how to use your embedded system. This section should THOROUGHLY describe its usage (i.e., more than just "Push start").*

## Data Analysis
*You'll complete this section at the end of the project.*

*Describe your results of your data collection, and what you learned from it. Your analysis should reflect on changes that were expected, those that were unexpected, and determine if your sustainability project met the goal of improving sustainability. If it did meet the goal of improving sustainability, qualify and quantify, as best possible, those improvements. If the project did not meet the goal of improving sustainability, discuss possible explanations for the results and modifications or changes to the project that might improve the outcomes.*

## Errors and Constraints
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

*Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your product. 
Also, list any constraints that must exist for your product to work 
(e.g., Only works in low light situations).*

## References
*Start this section at the beginning of the project, and update it throughout.*

*Throughout this project, you'll be used outside resources.
Reference ALL ideas or code which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes
online sources, ChatGPT, people who have helped you, and any other resources that
are not solely your own contribution. Include ALL resources you
looked at, not just the ones you ended up using directly.*

## Summary and Reflection
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Write 3 - 5 paragraphs on your reactions to the final project. 
Your reflection should be thoughtful and reflective. 
First, report on what you did. Then, reflect on those actions. 
It's a look back at what you learned by doing this project, but good and bad. 
You should be critical of shortcomings (yours, as well as the instructors/assignments) 
as well as celebratory of what was achieved.

## Final Self-Evaluations
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project. 
Assign points to each team member in each category, based on their contribution to the team. 
The sum of all member's points in each category cannot exceed 10. 
For example, for Coding, Partner 1 could get 7 points, and Partner 2 gets 3 points. 
You can't give both people 6 points each though, as the sum exceeds 10.

### Ideation, Brainstorming, Design:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Code creation: 

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Documentation creation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Teamwork & Participation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*
