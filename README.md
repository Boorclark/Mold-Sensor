## Purpose
**Air Quality/Humidity Sensor for Mold**: The Air Quality/Humidity Sensor for Mold is an innovative and accessible solution that provides multiple benefits to Berea College's campus community. By promoting environmental sustainability and detecting mold growth, the sensor helps to prevent the need for harsh chemicals and other remediation methods, reducing the harm done to the environment. Additionally, it helps to maintain the health and well-being of the campus community by detecting the presence of mold, a common health hazard that can cause respiratory problems and allergic reactions. 

## Initial Design Plan
