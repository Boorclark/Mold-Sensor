## Purpose

**Soil Moisture Monitor**: The purpose of our project is to contribute to living sustainably by creating an embedded system that solves an environmental issue. There are numerous benefits that link to having plants indoors such as an improvement in air quality, reducing stress, improve environmental wellness, etc. House plants are living things, and they require care just like any other living things. It is important to provide the proper care to plants for them to flourish in their environment. As humans, we must make sure that they are receiving an adequate amount of sunlight, water, prune and cut away their leaves, stems, and branches so that they are healthy. Taking care of plants can be tricky at times as some plants require more/less water based on their soil moisture. We will create an embedded system that tracks the soil moisture of the plant, so that we know about how much water should be given. 

**Air Quality/Humidity Sensor for Mold**: The Air Quality/Humidity Sensor for Mold is an innovative and accessible solution that provides multiple benefits to Berea College's campus community. By promoting environmental sustainability and detecting mold growth, the sensor helps to prevent the need for harsh chemicals and other remediation methods, reducing the harm done to the environment. Additionally, it helps to maintain the health and well-being of the campus community by detecting the presence of mold, a common health hazard that can cause respiratory problems and allergic reactions. 

**Gas Leak Detector** :  Gas leak detectors are important because they can help protect people from the harmful effects of gas leaks. Gas leaks can occur in homes, businesses, and other buildings, and can be caused by a variety of factors such as faulty appliances, damaged gas lines, or improper ventilation.
Gas leaks can be extremely dangerous because they can lead to explosions, fires, or poisoning from inhaling toxic gases. These risks can be especially dangerous because gas leaks are often odorless and invisible, making it difficult to detect them without the help of specialized equipment. We want to take preventive meausres by creating an embedded systems that can alert people if there is gas leak.

In no more than one paragraph, describe the problem your product will solve, and how.
